**DISCLAMER:** This write-up is for a university assignment/presentation. 

## Introduction

PHIL5830 assignment, based on the question:
> What is the connection between Cognitive Science and AI?

In this write-up I will define what Cognitive Science and Artifical Intelligence (AI) is. I will outline the connections between the two fields of study by giving a historical overview of the two discipline.
Further I will present and introduce some philosopical arguments and views in broader literature that I have researched for this question.

### Historic overview of Cognitive Science and AI

[^3] The study of the mind has been around since the ancient greek philosophers attempted to explain the nature of the human mind. In the 19th century, experimental psychology in the form of behaviorism took over virtually denying the exsistence of the mind.
Around 1956, George Miller summarized numerous studies and highlighted through these that the human mind is limited and requires chunking of memories for recording, mental representations and mental procedures with encoding and decoding to handle information.
At the same time as this was happening, McCarthy, Minsky, Newell and Simon were founding AI - and Chmosky began rejecting behaviourism through mental grammars consisting of rules.
This rejection of behaviourism, reinvigorated study of the mind and the development of AI as a field, are what we can view as Cognitive Science's intellectual origins. The thinkers mentioned above can be viewed as the founders of cognitive science.

[^1] AI as a field is devoted to building artifical creatrures that - in suitable contexts - *appear* to be animals or humans. While this is might not be the case for all researchers in the field of AI, it is of interest to philosophers (e.g.) through attempts at showing that these goals are un/attainable. AI does not only concern philosophy but also extends to - and is utilized in - many other fields of research. 
AI's offical start was in 1956 via a summer conference at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. This conference was notable for many reasons: the term "artifical intelligence" was coined there and Logic Theorist (LT) was revealed there (as a program LT was capable of proving elementary theorems in the propositional calculus).
The field itself was already in operation before this conference. Alan Turing, in his paper *Mind*, argues that the question "Can a machine think?" should be replaced with "Can a machine be linguistically indistinguishable from a human?". Along with this argument, he proposes his famous Turing Test (TT). TT continues to be at the heart of AI with attempts at passing the test and proving that these attempts did not succeed.
It is worth noting that Descartes proposed a test like TT, which to some extent is more demanding than TT.[^4] In short, the test is similar to that of TT in that a machine has to pass as "human" to an observer. However, a computer will only pass descartes test if it has the *capacity* to answer arbitrary questions.
In present day and within certain areas machines, or AI, out-perfom minds. AI has however not been able to create *general* intelligence (meaning the adaptability of being able to learn and develop knowledge beyond its original programmed intention).

### The Programmatic Impasse in AI and Cognitive Science

[^5] This book states that there is a programmatic impasse in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, explains why this is and outlines an alternative approach to transcend this impasse.

### The Standard Model of the Mind

[^2] The purpose of this article is to begin the process of engaging the international research community in developing what can be called a standard model of the mind, where the mind we have in mind here is human-like. The notion of a standard model has its roots in physics, where over more than a half-century the international community has developed and tested a standard model that combines much of what is known about particles. This model is assumed to be internally consistent, yet still have major gaps. Its function is to serve as a cumulative reference point for the field while also driving efforts to both extend and break it.


### Simulating the Human Mind and its Complexity

[^6] This study encompassed around the interdisciplinary study of cognitive science in the field of artificial intelligence. Past as well as current areas of research have been highlighted such that better understating of the topic can be ensured. Furthermore, some of the present-day applications of cognitive science artificial intelligence have been discussed as these can be considered as the foundation for further improvement. Prior to discussion about future scopes, real-time complexities have been revealed.
