## Checking out Jekyll's markdown syntax

This is just a test post for me to try out different markdown syntax!

### Basic syntax

I can make text **bold**.

I can make text *italic*.

> I can make a block quote!

How about lists?
1. Yeah,
2. they work!
3. This one is ordered
- and this one
- is not!

I can even add `codeblocks`!

I can add links as well, check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/trgyve)!

## Here is some extended syntax: 

Fenced codeblock:
```
#!/bin/bash echo 

"Hello World!"; 

exit 0;
```

Table:

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text | 

Footnote:
> I am a piece of obscure text that makes no sense. [^1]

[^1]: And I'm its footnote

Heading ID:
### Another incredible heading {#fancy-id}

Definition list:

term
: definition

I can ~~striketrhoaugh~~ strikethrough text!

To-do list: 
- [ ] This is like github
- [x] Yes it is

THERE ARE EMOJIS! :joy: <-- did not seem to work

Highlighting is <mark>good</mark>.

Sub- and superscript:

H~2~O

X^2^
