**DISCLAMER:** This write-up is for a university assignment. 

## Premise

Collection page for resources found, relating to the question:
> What is the connection between Cognitive Science and AI? 

Along with a presentation outline for how to best present the question and it's sub-questions.

### Outline Suggestions

- Breakdown of question
	- What is Cognitive Science
	- What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Brief history
	- Their origins
	- Significant paradigms that overlap if any
- Their connection
	- Previously
	- Currently
	- In the future
- Is their connection good or bad?
	- Does utilizing AI to attempt to model cognition hinder Cognitive Science, or vice versa?
	- Is AI limited due to it being model on what we as humans recognize cognition to be?

### Research Section

This section contains links to various sources found when researching this question. With interesting sections highligheted via block quotes.

#### [Cognitive Science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science)
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's general introduction to Cognitive Science, could be used as a supplement to the previous required reading covering the same topic.

The study of the mind has been around since the ancient greek philosophers attempted to explain the nature of the human mind. In the 19th century, experimental psychology in the form of behaviorism took over virtually denying the exsistence of the mind.
Around 1956, George Miller summarized numerous studies and highlighted through these that the human mind is limited and requires chunking of memories for recording, mental representations and mental procedures with encoding and decoding to handle information.
At the same time as this was happening, McCarthy, Minsky, Newell and Simon were founding AI - and Chmosky began rejecting behaviourism through mental grammars consisting of rules.

This rejection of behaviourism, reinvigorated study of the mind and the development of AI as a field, are what we can view as Cognitive Science's intellectual origins. The thinkers mentioned above can be viewed as the founders of cognitive science.

### [Artificial Intelligence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/artificial-intelligence/)
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's general introduction to AI.

Artifical Intelligence (AI) as a field is devoted to building artifical creatrures that - in suitable contexts - *appear* to be animals or humans. While this is might not be the case for all researchers in the field of AI, it is of interest to philosophers (e.g.) through attempts at showing that these goals are un/attainable.
AI as a field does not only concern philosophy but also extends to - and is utilized in - many other fields of research.

AI's offical start was in 1956 via a summer conference at Dartmouth College in Hanvoer, New Hampshire. This conferenence was notable for many reasons: the term "artifical intelligence" was coined there, Logich Theorist (LT) was revealed there. As a program LT was capable of proving elementary theorems in the propositional calculus.
The field itself was already in operation before this conference. Alan Turing, in his paper *Mind*, argues that the question "Can a machine think?" should be replaced with "Can a machine be linguistically indistinguishable from a human?". Along with this argument, he proposes his famous Turing Test (TT). TT continues to be at the heart of AI with attempts at passing the test and proving that these attempts did not succeed.

In certain areas machines, or AI, out-perfom minds. AI has however not been able to create *general* intelligence (meaning the adaptability of being able to learn and develop knowledge beyond its original programmed intention).


#### [Cognitive science in the era of artificial intelligence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027717303013)
A roadmap for reverse-engineering the infant language-learner

A seemingly interesting use-case for AI within Cognitive Science. 

#### [AI and Cognitive Science: The Past and Next 30 Years](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01083.x)
A look into AI's progress in the last 30 years - parallel to, but not within the field of Cognitive Science.

States that AI has been "shunned" from the Cognitive Science society, but is still making headway in terms of developing AI as a field.

#### [Simulating the human mind and its complexity](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/ccs.2019.0022)
A study explaining how AI can simulate the human mind, and the issues that arise from attempting to do so.

#### [Foundational issues in AI and Cognitive Science](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mLleWkFyESoC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=cognitive+science+and+ai&ots=Mno-Hff6UW&sig=pX5-T_5_OVDPU6jyw5Gd5rt2YxU#v=onepage&q&f=false) 
This book states that there is a programmatic impasse in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, explains why this is and outlines an alternative approach to transcend this impasse.

#### [On the Role of AI in the Ongoing Paradigm Shift within the Cognitive Sciences](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-77296-5_7)
Supports the view that the ongoing shift from orthodox to embodied-embedded cognitive science has been significantly influenced by the experimental results generated by AI research.
